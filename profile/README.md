## Heya, I'm Alice!

I created Clearcord due to concerns over Discord, one of the leading social media messaging platforms. As Discord's practices raised privacy issues and exhibited hostile behaviors towards users and developers, I took it upon myself to develop Clearcord as an alternate platform.

Clearcord is designed to be secure and user-friendly. We ensure that we have no access to your messages unless explicitly reported. Clearcord operates on the principle of complete privacy for our users. Messages are encrypted so that only you and the intended recipients can view them. This encryption covers all forms of communication within the app, including texts, voice messages, and uploaded files.

I firmly believe that no one should have access to your messages without your consent. Therefore, neither I nor any of our staff can access the content of your messages or any other private data without your explicit permission.

Clearcord adheres to data minimization principles, collecting only necessary information to provide our service. The data we collect includes your email address (used solely for a welcome and verification email) and your date of birth (used during sign-up).

In terms of accountability and transparency, Clearcord handles reported content with utmost sensitivity and in compliance with our community guidelines. We empower our users with robust tools for content moderation and provide clear mechanisms for reporting inappropriate behavior or content.

At Clearcord, we value user feedback and actively involve our community in shaping the future of our platform.
