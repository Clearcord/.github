## Heya, I'm Alice!

I created Clearcord due to concerns over Discord, one of the leading social media messaging platforms. As Discord's practices raised privacy issues, and hostile behaviours towards users abd developers. I took it upon myself to develop Clearcord emerged as an alternate platom. Clearcord is made to be secure and friendly and we ensure that we have no access to your messages unless explicitly reported due to concerns.

Clearcord is based on the principle of copmplete privacy for our users. Messages are encrypted so no one outside of you and the other person(s) can view them. This encryption extends to all forms of communication within the app, including texts, voice messages, and uploaded files. I believe in the idea that no one should be allowed to view anything you send, so I nor any staff cannot access the content of your messages or any other private data without your explicit consent.

Clearcord ensures data minimization principles, collecting only the information deemed necessary to provide our service. The data we collect is your email address used to sign up (we will not send you any emails other than a welcome email and a verification email), and the Date of Birth used during the sign up process

In terms of accountability and transparency, Clearcord ensures that any reported content is handled with utmost sensitivity and in compliance with our community guidelines. We empower our users with robust tools for content moderation and provide clear mechanisms for reporting inappropriate behavior or content.

At Clearcord, we strive for user feedback and want to involve our community in helping us create the future of our platform.
